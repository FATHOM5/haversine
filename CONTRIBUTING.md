# Contributing to package FATHOM5/haversine
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase, and we actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Star the FATHOM5/haversine package so we can grow community-based geospatial measurement tools together.
2. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints...especially for the Go files.
6. Submit that pull request to our `dev` branch.

We will review the pull and get you some **feedback in less than a week**.  If you don't hear from us, say something by commenting on the PR and tagging one of the maintainers.
If we like the idea you are proposing we will most likely accept your PR without requesting changes on the `dev` branch and make any small typographical or documentation changes ourselves. Then we will merge dev with master and roll the patch number so we stay compliant with go module support.
This workflow gives us plenty of flexibility to ensure changes on master don't break the private repos where we use this open source tool and a simplified workflow for contributors.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/FATHOM5/haversine/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/FATHOM5/haversine/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Great bug reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

We *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Use the style from [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) which is the same one enforced by most Go linters. This helps all of us write code that can be understood by gophers around the world.
